# Creating Sprites for Godot: A Simple Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple sprite for your Godot game by finding an image online and removing its background.

## Step 1: Find an Image

The first step is to find an image you want to use as a sprite. We will use the Startpage search engine for this.

1.  Open your web browser and go to [https://www.startpage.com](https://www.startpage.com).
2.  Click on the "Images" tab at the top of the page to switch to an image search.
3.  In the search bar, type what you are looking for. For example, "red car" or "alien spaceship". Try to find images with a simple, plain background, as this will make background removal easier.
4.  Browse through the results and click on an image you like.
5.  Right-click on the image and select "Open Image in New Tab" (for firefox) or something similar for your browser.
5.  Once you have the full-size image open, right-click on it and select "Save Image As...".
6.  Save the image to a location on your computer where you can easily find it, like your Desktop, the Downloads folder or a dedicated project folder.

## Step 2: Remove the Background

Now that you have an image, we need to remove its background so it can be used as a sprite with a transparent background in Godot. We will use a free online tool called `remove.bg`.

1.  Open a new tab in your web browser and go to [https://www.remove.bg/upload](https://www.remove.bg/upload).
2.  You will see a page with a button that says "Upload Image". You can either:
    *   Click the "Upload Image" button and select the image you saved in Step 1.
    *   Drag and drop the image file from your computer directly onto the web page.
3.  `remove.bg` will automatically process your image. After a few seconds, it will show you a preview of your image with the background removed.
4.  If you are happy with the result, click the "Download" button to save the new image. This will download a `.png` file with a transparent background. The free version only creates a smaller version of the image.

## Step 3: Use Your Sprite in Godot

Congratulations! You now have a transparent PNG image that you can use as a sprite in your Godot project.

Simply drag and drop the new image file from your computer into the "FileSystem" dock in your Godot editor to import it into your project. You can then use it with a `Sprite2D` node or any other node that accepts a texture.

This method is great for creating placeholder art or sprites for game jams and prototypes quickly.
